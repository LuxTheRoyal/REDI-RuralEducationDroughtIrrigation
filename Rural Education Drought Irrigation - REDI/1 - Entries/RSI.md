**Duration:** Six weeks (June 22 – August 2, 2025) on the MIT campus in Cambridge, MA

**Cost & Financial Aid:** Completely free for participants—tuition, housing, meals, and lab materials provided at no cost. Some U.S. travel support may be offered, but students typically cover travel to/from MIT themselves.

**Overview:** RSI is one of the world’s most prestigious pre-college STEM research programs. Participants begin with intensive seminars led by MIT faculty, then conduct mentored independent research at MIT or nearby institutions, culminating in a final symposium to present findings. Alumni have gone on to publish research and often attend top-tier universities.

**Acceptance Rate:** Approximately 3–5%—around 80–100 students selected out of roughly 3,000+ applicants annually.

**Application Deadline:** January 2025 for the 2025 program (typically early‐ to mid‑January). All materials must be submitted by this date; decisions communicated in late February to March.
